    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at Georgia Tech in the
      School of Interactive Computing. I’m broadly interested in Networks and
      HCI, and am hoping to focus on topics around access and education.

      I was previously a software engineer at Indica Labs in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico, where I worked as the team lead for the collaborative web
      application, HALO Link. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer
      Science at The University of New Mexico where I also completed a
      minor in Fine Arts through the Interdisciplinary Film and Digital Media
      program.

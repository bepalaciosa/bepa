    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a Computer Science PhD student at Georgia Tech in the
      School of Interactive Computing.
      I work with Dr. Ellen Zegura at the Computing and Society Lab.
      My research focuses on measuring and characterizing Internet
      access and quality of coverage in underserved communities, particularly
      in tribal lands in the United States.
      My goal is to inform policy and technological efforts to
      bridge the digital divide in such communities.

      I was previously a software engineer at Indica Labs in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico, where I worked as the team lead for the collaborative web
      application, HALO Link. I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer
      Science at The University of New Mexico where I also completed a
      minor in Fine Arts through the Interdisciplinary Film and Digital Media
      program.
